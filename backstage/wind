Notes for Wind:

The high queen's name is Telipse, vaguely from Greek for "distant" and "high".

Gela's name was made by starting with the reconstructed Proto-Germanic origin of "low", "lÄ“gaz", and munging the letters until it sounded like an okay name.

Gela takes lovers of all genders. She only propositions some of the travelers. Sometimes she takes money for sleeping with them and sometimes not.
