The process of writing involves planning, notes, and other materials that inform the final work but are not explicitly present in the text. In the interest of enabling contributors to coordinate effectively, such "backstage" information is collected here.

Naturally, this means that the documents in this directory may contain major spoilers even if you have already read everything else.
