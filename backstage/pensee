Notes for Pens√©e:

The setting is A Midsummer Night's Dream. The characters are John Watson (John Stitch) and Sherlock Holmes (Hemlock). The names are adjusted to fit the naming scheme of the play: "Stitch" is a reference to John's profession as a surgeon, following the naming of the rude mechanicals, and "Hemlock" because fairies are named after plants (and for the phonetic similarity, and the reference to Plato's suicide).

The white-turned-purple flower is love-in-idleness, which in AMND causes one to fall in love with the next person one sees. Wikipedia identifies it with the wild pansy, whose name comes from the French referring to thought. The character of Holmes is associated with thought, but the flower makes his thoughts less tame, less under his control; John calls the flower "wild-thought". The title is a reference to this flower.

John says that the wild pansy can treat demonic possession; this is a reference to its use in treating epilepsy. Hemlock notably does not confirm or deny the possession theory.

Hemlock speaks in unrhymed iambic pentameter.

Hemlock identifies himself specifically as a servant of Titania, omitting Oberon. Titania is an alt of Irene Adler; some time in the backstory, she outsmarted Hemlock and thereby won his undying loyalty.

The characters accept as simple fact the Christian theological worldview, but do not share the corresponding values, which is a common trope in glowfic and rationalfic.

Fairy tales sometimes hold that eating food while in the land of Fairie consigns one to remain there forever.

At the end of the story, both John and Hemlock are attracted to each other, but a relationship between them at this point could not be consensual in either direction: Hemlock is drugged, and John fears the wrath of a fairy should he deny Hemlock anything. They might be able to develop a relationship eventually, but they will have serious difficulties to overcome first.
